# Dragon-Hoard

##  This application is a discord bot wrote in Python that allows control of a token currency that is currently maintained in a CSV file.

In order to use this bot, duplicate the .env.example and rename it to .env and then import your correct token into the variable DISCORD_TOKEN='Token'

You will need to make that token available globally for the CLI to be able to access the variable os wide.

You will also need to install Discord via PIP.

You can reference this documentation for that.
https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

You can then run the application.
